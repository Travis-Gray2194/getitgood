//Travis Gray GetitGotitGood Assignment
//Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
// But for multiples of three print “Get it” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Got it'
// For numbers which are multiples of 10, print "Good".
// So  for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “Get it Got it”.
// Numbers which are multiples of three, five and ten, print "Get it Got it Good"
